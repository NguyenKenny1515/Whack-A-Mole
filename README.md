# Whack-A-Mole

A simulation of the classic Whack-A-Mole game implemented using Java and Java Swing. The holes are randomly generated and one mole will appear out of one of them at random. Users can create accounts to save their scores and view the list of the highest scores during a session. Users can also select from three difficulty options which influence the speed at which the holes and mole appear. Includes background music.
